\description{
Philosophy: Accessibility-first design optimized for scientific visualization.
\itemize{
  \item Based on Okabe-Ito colorblind-safe palette (first 8 colors)
  \item Specifically designed to be distinguishable by people with common colorblindness
  \item Extends base 8 colors through systematic brightness variations (-40%, -25%, +25%, +40%)
  \item Perceptually balanced colors with similar visual weights
  \item Maintains accessibility properties across all brightness levels
  \item Professional, publication-ready appearance suitable for scientific contexts
  \item Optimized for complex multi-group genomics visualizations (e.g., 20+ cell types)
  \item Prioritizes inclusivity and clarity over visual impact
  \item Best for: Scientific publications, collaborative research, colorblind-accessible visualizations
