\title{Convert Gene Symbols Between Species Using Orthologs}
\usage{
getHomologousSymbols(symbols, current = "mouse", target = "human")
}
\arguments{
\item{symbols}{Character vector of gene symbols to convert}

\item{current}{Character string specifying the input species. Default is
"mouse". See \code{\link[orthogene]{convert_orthologs}} for supported
species names.}

\item{target}{Character string specifying the output species. Default is
"human". See \code{\link[orthogene]{convert_orthologs}} for supported
species names.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same number of rows as the input \code{symbols} vector.
  The data frame contains two columns: the input species symbols and their
  corresponding orthologous symbols in the target species. The input order
  is preserved. Genes without orthologs are represented as empty strings ("").
}
\description{
Converts gene symbols from one species to their orthologous symbols in
another species using the orthogene package. For genes with multiple
orthologs (non-1:1 mappings), returns the most popular ortholog mapping.
}
\details{
This function wraps \code{orthogene::convert_orthologs} to provide a
simplified interface for gene symbol conversion. When multiple orthologs
exist for a single input gene (non-1:1 mappings), the function uses the
\code{non121_strategy = "keep_popular"} option, which returns the most
"popular" interspecies ortholog mappings based on frequency across databases.

Note that this strategy maximizes the number of genes returned but may include
some orthologs that are not true biological 1:1 orthologs due to evolutionary
gene duplication or divergence events.

The function guarantees a 1:1 correspondence between input and output through
the use of \code{match()}, ensuring that each input gene has exactly one row
in the output, with empty strings ("") for genes without identified orthologs.

\examples{
# Convert mouse genes to human orthologs
mouse_genes <- c("Trp53", "Brca1", "Pbsn")
getHomologousSymbols(mouse_genes, current = "mouse", target = "human")

# Convert human genes to mouse orthologs
human_genes <- c("TP53", "RB1", "FOXP3")
getHomologousSymbols(human_genes, current = "human", target = "mouse")

# Convert between other species
getHomologousSymbols(c("Tp53", "Brca1"), current = "mouse", target = "rat")
