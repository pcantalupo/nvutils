\usage{
tsv2xlsx(
  file,
  outfile,
  colClasses = "character",
  na.strings = NULL,
  show_col_types = NULL,
  guess_max = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to a tab-separated (.tsv) file with a header row.}

\item{outfile}{Output Excel file path.}

\item{colClasses}{Character vector or "character" to force all columns to character. Use NULL to allow type guessing. See data.table::fread.}

\item{na.strings}{Character vector of strings to interpret as missing; use NULL to disable NA conversion and keep empty fields as "" and the literal "NA" as "NA".}

\item{show_col_types}{Deprecated. No longer used.}

\item{guess_max}{Deprecated. Use colClasses instead.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to data.table::fread.}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. Called for its side effect of writing an XLSX file.
}
\description{
Read a tab-separated file with data.table::fread and write it to an XLSX with openxlsx::write.xlsx.
}
\details{
Default colClasses = "character" prevents type guessing and preserves the file contents as text, including leading zeros. With na.strings = NULL, empty fields remain "" and "NA" remains the 2-character string, which will appear as blank cells and "NA" text in Excel, respectively.

If you want fread to infer types, set colClasses = NULL. If you want certain tokens treated as missing, set na.strings accordingly.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Preserve empty strings and the literal "NA" as text
tsv2xlsx("foo.tsv", "foo.xlsx")

# Allow type guessing
tsv2xlsx("foo.tsv", "foo.xlsx", colClasses = NULL)

# Treat "NA" and "" as missing
tsv2xlsx("foo.tsv", "foo.xlsx", colClasses = NULL, na.strings = c("NA", ""))
}
