\description{
Philosophy: Maximizes perceptual distance between colors using algorithmic methods.
\itemize{
  \item Uses computational optimization to create colors as visually distinct as possible
  \item Starts from RGB primaries and creates maximum separation in color space
  \item Prioritizes visual impact and distinctness over colorblind accessibility
  \item More saturated/vibrant colors for high visual contrast
  \item Generated algorithmically rather than hand-curated
  \item Best for: When you need maximum color separation and colorblind accessibility is not primary concern
